          Solar energy is becoming a popular choice for homes and businesses,
          yet many myths and misconceptions still prevent people from making the
          switch. In this article, we'll debunk some of the most common myths
          about solar power and reveal the truth behind them.

            Myth #1: Solar Panels Don't Work in Cloudy or Rainy Weather
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p className="pl-4">
                üîç Fact: Solar panels work even when it's cloudy or raining!
              </p>
              <p>
                Solar panels don't need direct sunlight to generate power‚Äîthey
                can still produce electricity from diffused sunlight. While they
                are most efficient in direct sunlight, they still operate at
                10-25% efficiency on cloudy days. Countries like Germany and the
                UK, which have less sunshine than Nigeria, are among the leading
                users of solar power.
              </p>
              <p className="pl-4">
                üí° Tip: If you live in an area with frequent cloudy weather,
                consider high-efficiency solar panels and a battery storage
                system to store excess energy.

                Solar panels are mounted with specialized racking systems that
                do not harm your roof. Instead, they act as a protective layer,
                reducing wear and tear from sun exposure, wind, and rain.
