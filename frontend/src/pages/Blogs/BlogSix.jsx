          Solar energy is a great alternative to traditional power sources, but
          a common concern is whether solar panels can generate electricity on
          rainy or cloudy days. If you've ever wondered whether solar panels
          work when the sun isn't shining brightly, this article will clear up
          the facts

            Do Solar Panels Work When It's Cloudy or Raining?
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p>
                ‚úÖ Yes, solar panels still generate electricity on cloudy or
                rainy days! Solar panels rely on light, not heat to produce
                electricity. Even when the sky is overcast, some sunlight still
                reaches the panels, though at a reduced intensity. On a cloudy
                day, solar panels typically operate at 10% to 25% efficiency
                compared to full sunlight.

              <p>
                üí° Fun Fact: Countries like Germany and the UK, which experience
                frequent cloudy weather, still successfully use solar power on a
                large scale!

            How Do Solar Panels Produce Energy Without Direct Sunlight?
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p>
                Solar panels work by converting photons (light particles) into
                electricity. While direct sunlight provides the most energy,
                diffused sunlight (which passes through clouds) can still be
                captured and converted into power.

            What Happens to Solar Power Output When It Rains?
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p>
                Rain itself does not stop solar panels from working. In fact,
                rain can be beneficial because it helps clean dust and dirt off
                the panels, improving efficiency. However, heavy rain clouds may
                reduce energy production more significantly compared to light
                clouds.
