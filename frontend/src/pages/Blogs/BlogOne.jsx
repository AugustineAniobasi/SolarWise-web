            How Much Can You Save with Solar Energy?

          Switching to solar energy isn't just about sustainabilityâ€”it's also a
          smart financial move. With rising electricity costs and frequent power
          outages in many regions, investing in solar can significantly cut your
          energy bills. But how much can you actually save? Let's break it down.
        </p>

        <ol className="ml-5 flex list-decimal flex-col gap-8 text-[#2266DE]">
          <li>
            Before calculating savings, you need to know:
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p>âœ… Your current electricity bill (monthly or yearly).</p>
              <p>
                âœ… Your energy consumption (measured in kilowatt-hours, kWh).
              </p>
              <p>âœ… The cost per kWh charged by your electricity provider.</p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                For example, if your home uses 500 kWh per month and your
                electricity provider charges â‚¦80 per kWh, your monthly
                electricity bill is: ðŸ‘‰ â‚¦40,000 per month (â‚¦80 x 500 kWh).

            How Solar Cuts Your Electricity Costs
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p>
                A well-sized solar system can generate up to 100% of your home's
                energy needs, reducing or even eliminating your electricity
                bill. However, savings depend on:
              </p>
              <ul className="mt-2 ml-5 list-disc">
                <li>
                  The size of your solar system (number of panels and battery
                  capacity).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your sunlight exposure (Nigeria and most African countries
                  receive ample sunlight).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whether you have battery storage (helps store power for
                  nighttime use).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-4 font-semibold">Example of Solar Savings</p>
              <p>
                If a solar system covers 80% of your energy needs, your new bill
                would be:
              </p>
              <p>ðŸš€ â‚¦8,000 instead of â‚¦40,000 per month!</p>
              <p>ðŸ’° That's a â‚¦32,000 monthly saving and â‚¦384,000 per year!</p>

            How Long Does It Take To Break Even?
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p>
                A solar system for an average home may cost between â‚¦2 million
                to â‚¦5 million, depending on size and battery capacity.
              </p>
              <ul className="mt-2 ml-5 list-disc">
                <li>
                  If you save â‚¦384,000 per year, your system could pay for
                  itself in 5-7 years.
                </li>
                <li>
