          Choosing the right solar panel for your home is essential for
          maximizing efficiency, savings, and long-term reliability. With
          various types of panels available, it's important to consider key
          factors like energy needs, budget, and space. This guide will help you
          determine the best solar panel for your home.

            Understanding Solar Panel Types
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p>
                There are three main types of solar panels, each with its
                advantages and drawbacks:
              </p>
              <p>ðŸ”¹ Monocrystalline Panels (Best for efficiency & longevity)</p>
              <p>âœ” High efficiency (18-22%) â€“ works well in limited space.</p>
              <p>âœ” Sleek black design and longer lifespan (25+ years).</p>
              <p> âœ” More expensive but provides the best power output.</p>
              <p>ðŸ”¹ Polycrystalline Panels (Budget-friendly option)</p>
              <p>
                âœ” Moderate efficiency (15-17%) â€“ requires more panels for the
                same output.
              </p>
              <p>
                âœ” Blue tint and slightly lower durability than monocrystalline.
              </p>
              <p>âœ” More affordable but takes up more roof space.</p>
              <p>ðŸ”¹ Thin-Film Panels (Best for flexibility & portability)</p>
              <p>
                âœ” Lightweight and flexible â€“ suitable for small applications.
              </p>
              <p>âœ” Lower efficiency (10-12%) and shorter lifespan.</p>
              <p>
                âœ” Ideal for temporary installations or areas with limited
                structural support.
              </p>

            How to Determine Your Energy Needs
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p>
                To choose the right panel, you need to calculate your energy
                consumption and roof space availability:
              </p>
              <p>
                âœ… Check your electricity bill - Identify your monthly kWh
                usage.
              </p>
              <p>
                âœ… Consider future energy needs - Will you add appliances or an
                electric car?
              </p>
              <p>
                âœ… Assess roof space & sunlight exposure - More shade requires
                higher-efficiency panels.
              </p>
              <p>
                ðŸ’¡ Example: If your home consumes 500 kWh per month, and a 350W
                solar panel generates 40 kWh per month, you'd need about 13-15
                panels to meet your energy needs.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

            Factors to Consider When Choosing Solar Panels
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <p>
                ðŸ“Œ Budget & Cost - Monocrystalline is expensive but efficient,
                while polycrystalline is more affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                ðŸ“Œ Durability & Warranty - Look for 25-year warranties for
                long-term savings.
              </p>
              <p>
                ðŸ“Œ Weather Conditions - High-efficiency panels work better in
                cloudy areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                ðŸ“Œ Battery Compatibility - If storing power, ensure
                compatibility with solar batteries
              </p>

            Should You Go for a Solar Kit or Custom Installation?
            <div className="mt-5 text-black">
              <ul className="mt-2 ml-5 list-disc">
                <li>
                  Solar Kits (DIY or pre-packaged systems) are cheaper but
                  require technical knowledge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Custom Installations are more efficient, designed for your
                  home, and include professional setup.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                ðŸ’¡ Tip: If unsure, use the Solar Needs Assessment Tool to
                calculate the perfect system for your home.
